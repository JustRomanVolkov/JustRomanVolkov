‚ö° **About me:**
For 11 years, I worked as a design engineer for water supply systems in various sectors such as airports, shopping malls, hotels, healthcare facilities, residential buildings, and industrial enterprises. Over 6 years, I advanced to the role of chief specialist, and 2 years later, I became the head of a project group of 10 people. During my engineering career, I encountered tasks that required writing scripts to automate drawing and calculations, which sparked my interest in Python.
